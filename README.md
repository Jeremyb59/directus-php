<h1 align="center">Directus 8</h1>

## 🐰 Introduction

Directus is an open-source tool that wraps your database with an API, and provides an intuitive admin app for non-technical users to manage its content. It's what you'd get if you mixed a headless CMS, database client, and WebApp builder. Created in 2004, our platform powers over a million data-driven projects around the world.

The Directus Suite consists of:

* **[Directus Database API](https://github.com/directus/api)** — Wraps any new or existing SQL database with RESTful JSON endpoints for connecting content anywhere: websites, native apps, wearables, IoT devices, kiosks, or anything else!
* **[Directus Admin App](https://github.com/directus/app)** — A friendly admin interface built with Vue.js that works in conjunction with our API to allow non-technical users to manage database content and digital assets.
